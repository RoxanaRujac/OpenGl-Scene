## Project Overview  
This project is a **3D graphical scene** created using **C++** and **OpenGL**, depicting a **deserted island** with various interactive elements. The scene includes environmental effects such as **fog, rain, dynamic lighting, and real-time shadows**, and allows users to explore and modify rendering settings for an immersive experience.  

## Technologies Used  
- **C** â€“ Core programming language for logic and rendering.  
- **OpenGL** â€“ Graphics API for rendering 3D objects and effects.  
- **Blender** â€“ Used for modeling 3D objects included in the scene.  

## Features  
- **3D Environment**: A detailed island with objects like palm trees, treasure, and a pirate shipwreck.  
- **Environmental Effects**: Implementations for **fog**, **rain**, and **transparent objects**.  
- **Lighting System**: Supports **directional and point lights**, with real-time shadow generation using **Shadow Mapping**.  
- **Rendering Modes**: Users can switch between **wireframe, polygonal, and smooth** visualizations.  
- **Interactive Camera**: Navigation using **keyboard and mouse controls**.

## Implementation Details  
- **Fog Effect**: Uses an exponential quadratic formula to interpolate colors based on depth.  
- **Rain Simulation**: Individual raindrops are rendered at random positions and reset when falling out of view.  
- **Transparency & Fragment Discarding**: Objects use an **alpha channel** to control visibility.  
- **Shadow Mapping**: Depth buffering technique to generate realistic shadows from a light source.  
- **3D Models & Textures**: Imported and rendered using OpenGL shaders.  

## User Interaction  
- **Camera Controls**:  
  - `W, A, S, D` â€“ Move forward, left, backward, right  
  - `Q, E` â€“ Rotate camera left, right  
- **Rendering Controls**:  
  - `X` â€“ Wireframe mode  
  - `Y` â€“ Polygonal mode  
  - `Z` â€“ Solid mode  
- **Lighting & Effects**:  
  - `O` â€“ Toggle directional light  
  - `P` â€“ Toggle point light  
  - `F` â€“ Toggle fog  
  - `T` â€“ Toggle transparency  
  - `M` â€“ Show depth map  

## Future Improvements  
- **Sound Effects & Background Music** for a more immersive experience.  
- **More Dynamic Objects** such as animated creatures and water waves.  
- **Improved Shadows** with soft shadowing techniques.  
- **Enhanced Navigation** with better path-following for the automatic tour mode.  

This project demonstrates fundamental **graphics programming concepts** and serves as a practical application of **real-time rendering techniques** in OpenGL. ðŸš€
